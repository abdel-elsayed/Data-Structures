# Data-Structures
Simple implementation of some Data Structures in C++

## Linear Data Structures :chains:

1. ### Linked-List  
   - :one:-:two:-:three:-:four:
   - Singly Linked-list
   - Doubly Linked-list

2. ### Stacks  
   - :one:-:two:-:three:-:four::arrow_right_hook:

3. ### Queues
   - :leftwards_arrow_with_hook::one:-:two:-:three:-:four:
   - Array-Based Queue
   - Linked-List Based Queue

4. ### Vectors  
   - :one::two::three::four::heavy_plus_sign:

## Non-Linear Data Structures
 ### Trees :evergreen_tree:

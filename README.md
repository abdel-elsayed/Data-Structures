# Data-Structures
Simple implementation of some Data Structures in C++

## Linear Data Structures :chains:

### Linked-List   :one:-:two:-:three:-:four:

### Stacks   :one:-:two:-:three:-:four::arrow_right_hook:

### Queues  :leftwards_arrow_with_hook::one:-:two:-:three:-:four:

### Vectors   :one::two::three::four::heavy_plus_sign:

## Non-Linear Data Structures
 ### Trees :evergreen_tree:
